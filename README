Grail42 Core is a subproject of the Grail42 project located at:

https://github.com/JoshHeitzman/grail42

This project provides a header file only C++ library that normalizes the usage interface
and output of the Template Unit Test Framework (TUT), Google Test (gtest), and CppUTest.
The headers have been built for and on Windows 7, Android 2.2 and Chrome Native Client 23.  
Builds were done using VC++ 2010 with the add-ins for the Android NDK and Chrome Native 
Client SDK (both of these use gcc rather than msvc), so the library is known to be 
cross-platform/multi-platform.

Additionally it includes a few tools that simplify faux console applications on Android 
and Google Native Client.  The example Visual Studio 2010 projects, which these tools 
have been tested with, are located in the sibling project Grail42 Templates (see the 
Grail42 project referenced above).

Also provided is a Python implementation of a partial prototype for querying 
annotations about any file, directory, items in a directory, or directory tree.  The 
annotations stored in plain text config files (probably XML and JSON as well later) 
and located at well known locations relative to the thing annotated.  The prototype
currently only provides support for annotating directory trees with the annotations
located in a file parallel to the tree.
